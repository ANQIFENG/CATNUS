**CATNUS: Coordinate-Aware Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation Using T1-Weighted MRI** 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05329).

CATNUS is a deep learning–based method for fast and accurate thalamic nuclei segmentation, 
distinguishing 13 thalamic nuclei classes to enable detailed structural and neuroanatomical analysis from T1-weighted MRI.

🚧 **[TO DO]** **Models and Source codes will be coming soon.**
